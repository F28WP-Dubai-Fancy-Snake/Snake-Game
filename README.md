# Fancy Snake

Fancy Snake is a 2D snake game in which users control a snake character using the keyboard, moving in 4 directions: up,down,left and right.

The objective is to be the biggest snake with the most collected fruit points, which can be collected from the ground. They can go all over the map and try to compete with different players.

A player's snake will die and revert to the starting length when it comes into contact with the wall, their own snake or other players' snakes in the game. There is also a timer that kills the shortest snake every few seconds, which should keep the players motivated to get
larger.
